/**
 * Picks the color for pixel (x, y).
 *
 * The first color fades into the second color as you move from the initial
 * fill point, the center, to the radius. Beyond the radius, all pixels
 * should be just color2.
 *
 * You should calculate the distance between two points using the standard
 * Manhattan distance formula,
 *
 * \f$dist = |center\_x - given\_x| + |center\_y - given\_y|\f$
 *
 * Then, scale the hue channel from fadeColor1 to
 * fadeColor2 linearly from d = 0 to d = radius.
 * 
 * 
 * The s, and l channels of the color should be 1.0 and 0.5, resp.
 *
 * For example, the hue at distance d where d is less than the radius
 * must be
 *
 * newHue = fadeColor1.h + (dist/radius) * ( |fadeColor1.h - fadeColor2.h|)
 * where |fadeColor1.h - fadeColor2.h| is the longest distance between
 * fadeColor1 and fadeColor2... if the distance is < 180, then use
 * 360 - the distance. You'll have to figure out what to do if color2.h
 * is larger than color1.h, as well. Note that the hue value is a rainbow
 * of colors between 0 and 360, and that it both begins and ends at red.
 * It is as if the colors are around a circle, and the angle corresponds to its
 * value. 
 *
 * Note that all values are floats. If you do not follow the above formula,
 * your colors may be very close but round differently than ours.
 *
 * @param x The x coordinate to pick a color for.
 * @param y The y coordinate to pick a color for.
 * @return The color selected for (x, y).
